This is my old color and shape matching game, it is made with the legacy JavaFX before it went open source.

The game randomly generates a shape and fills it with a random color, the player is then asked to pick the shape and color.

I created a ransomizer class with a function to pick a random color and shape and generate the shape on the screen.

The JFX_T.java file has the whole program including all three scenes and the randomizer class.
